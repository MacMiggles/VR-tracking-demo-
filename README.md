# VR-tracking-demo-
My attempt at macking a vr tracking system.
I still have some debug parts in the code. It is going to be removed in the next version.

This was made with poseNet and googles trainable Machine.
The tracking should be better if the entire body is on camera. This makes it much smoother.

I had some problems with the p5 editor. It didn't want to import the model for my google drive. 
This is not entirly fixed and is still a problem.

Have fun with it :)
